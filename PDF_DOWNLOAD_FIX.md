# PDF Download Fix - Report Cards

## Problem

The download buttons on all report cards were not functional - they only logged to console and didn't actually download any PDFs.

## Solution

Created a new dedicated folder for PDF report components and implemented proper download functionality for all reports.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Created New PDF Components Folder

- **Location**: `/frontend/src/components/pdf-reports/`
- **Purpose**: Separate folder for PDF generation components specific to our report use cases

#### 2. New PDF Components Created

1. **CustomerCreditPDF.tsx** - PDF for Customer Credit Report
2. **SupplierDebtPDF.tsx** - PDF for Supplier Debt Report
3. **TankLevelPDF.tsx** - PDF for Tank Level Report
4. **BankAccountPDF.tsx** - PDF for Bank Account Statement Report
5. **index.ts** - Barrel export file

#### 3. Updated Report Pages

Updated the following pages to implement actual PDF download functionality:

- `CustomerCreditReportPage.tsx`
- `SupplierDebtReportPage.tsx`
- `TankLevelReportPage.tsx`
- `BankAccountReportPage.tsx`

### How It Works

Each report page now:

1. Imports the `pdf` function from `@react-pdf/renderer`
2. Imports the corresponding PDF component from `@/components/pdf-reports`
3. Has a functional `handleDownload` function that:
   - Creates a PDF blob using the `pdf()` function with the report data
   - Creates a downloadable link with an appropriate filename
   - Automatically downloads the PDF when the button is clicked
   - Properly cleans up the object URL after download

### PDF Features

All PDF reports include:

- Professional formatting with custom Wotfard font
- Header with report title and date range
- Properly formatted tables with all relevant data
- Summary section with totals
- Footer with generation timestamp
- Landscape orientation for better table visibility
- Proper currency and number formatting (Indian locale)

### File Naming Convention

Downloaded PDFs follow this pattern:

- `customer-credit-report-YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`
- `supplier-debt-report-YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`
- `tank-level-report-[TankName]-YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`
- `bank-account-report-[AccountNumber]-YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Navigate to any report page (Reports → Detailed Reports → Select a report)
2. Fill in the date range and filters
3. Click "Get Report" button
4. Click "Download Report" button
5. A PDF should now download to your system

## Technical Details

### Data Structure Mapping

The PDF components were carefully mapped to match the actual data structures in the application:

- **Bank Account Ledger**: Uses `credit`/`debit` fields, not `credits`/`debits`
- **Tank Ledger**: Uses `addition`/`removal` types with `volume` and `level` fields
- **Supplier**: Uses `contactNumber` field, not `phoneNumber`
- **Bank Account**: Uses `accountHolderName` field, not `accountName`

### Dependencies

Uses existing `@react-pdf/renderer` package already in the project.
